Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X
and Unix.

NOTE: This builds the stable version of wine. If you need
cutting-edge then you may want to check out wine-staging.

If your video card does not support hardware-accelerated OpenGL, then
run the script like this:  OPENGL=NO ./wine.SlackBuild

NOTE: This will not build on a stock 64bit Slackware system, and we
do not support doing so with 32bit-compatibility packages.  That
doesn't mean that it won't work - we just don't support it at all.

Optional dependencies:

fontforge
webcore-fonts
