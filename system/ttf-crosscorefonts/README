ttf-crosscorefonts (Chrome OS core fonts)

Google has created a set of fonts for its ChromeOS Operating system.

The three standard ones closely mimic the most popular ones for the
Windows platform and Linux's so-called Liberation fonts but are
available under an OpenFont license.

Tinos, Arimo and Cousine, appear to be variations of the old standard
Times, Arial and Courier.
