Post installation:
- Create a new directory /keybase using root account
  mkdir /keybase
- Change owner of that directory to the local user (eg. willysr)
  chown willysr /keybase
- Run run_keybase as local user
  A new .desktop file will be created by the service on first launch
  in ~/.config/autostart/ to invoke this script.

PS: You need to execute run_keybase after new installation or
upgrade from previous version. This script will stop existing
services and re-mount everything again.
