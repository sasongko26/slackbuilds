# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mlocate: mlocate (locate/updatedb implementation)
mlocate:
mlocate: mlocate is a locate/updatedb implementation. It keeps a database
mlocate: of all existing files and allows you to lookup files by name. The
mlocate: 'm' stands for "merging": updatedb reuses the existing database
mlocate: to avoid rereading most of the file system, which makes updatedb
mlocate: faster and does not trash the system caches as much as traditional
mlocate: locate implementations.
mlocate:
mlocate: This conflicts with Slackware 14.2's slocate package. See README
mlocate: for details.
