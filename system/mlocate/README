mlocate (locate/updatedb implementation)

mlocate is a locate/updatedb implementation. It keeps a database of all
existing files and allows you to lookup files by name. The 'm' stands for
"merging": updatedb reuses the existing database to avoid rereading most
of the file system, which makes updatedb faster and does not trash the
system caches as much as traditional locate implementations.

This is the same "locate" that's in Slackware-current (and eventually 15.0).

This conflicts with Slackware 14.2's slocate package! Before installing
this, add slocate to /etc/slackpkg/blacklist and then:

  # removepkg slocate

It's also recommended to:

  # rm -rf /var/lib/slocate /etc/updatedb.conf

The locate database will be created daily, as a cron job. If you don't
want to wait, you can create it manually:

  # /etc/cron.daily/mlocate

If you want to revert to Slackware's slocate, remove slocate from
/etc/slackpkg/blacklist, then:

  # removepkg mlocate
  # rm -rf /var/lib/mlocate /etc/updatedb.conf
  # slackpkg update
  # slackpkg install slocate
