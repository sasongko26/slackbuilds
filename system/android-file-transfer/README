Android File Transfer for Linux - reliable MTP client with
minimalistic UI similar to Android File Transfer for Mac.

Android File Transfer by default builds qt4 ui (or qt5,
if installed).  However, in building only the client,
without ui, run the script with the following command:

QT_GUI=no ./android-file-transfer.SlackBuild
