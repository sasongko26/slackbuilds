wine-staging (Wine Staging is the testing area of winehq.org)

<<<<<<< HEAD
It  contains  bug fixes and features, which have not been  integrated
into the development branch yet.  The  idea  of  Wine  Staging  is to
provide  experimental  features  faster  to  end  users  and  to give
developers  the  possibility  to  discuss  and  improve their patches
before they are integrated into the main branch.

This  is  a  current  development  branch  of Wine appended with full
patches of Staging area.

NOTE: At the moment, it only compiles a 32-bit version of Wine,
this may change in the future with the ability to compile both
64-bit and 32-bit versions of Wine. You'll need a full multilib
system in order to compile this under x86_64 system.

While this is list as a separate package, this WILL overwrite
your normal Wine binaries! Please keep this in mind.

Compile options/optional dependences (keep in mind, you need
32-bit libs of each):

See README.SLACKWARE for a giant list of dependencies.
