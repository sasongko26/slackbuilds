vtcol - Colour schemes for the Linux console

Change the colour scheme of the virtual Linux console.

Note:
rust is a dependency at build-time, not a runtime dep.

By default, the slackbuild requires all crate dependencies to be downloaded
individually. Optionally, iff you have cargo-vendor installed, you can create
a "vendored" tarball which contains all the crate dependencies exploded into a
single directory and then compressed together as a tarball.

The script vtcol-mkvendortarball.sh will generate this for you. The slackbuild
will automatically use this tarball if found in the current directory.
