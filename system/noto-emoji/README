noto-emoji - Color and Black-and-White Noto emoji fonts

I haven't included a font config in this package since I am still
experimenting with the best configuration. Currently, I am using this

  https://gist.github.com/hexchain/47f550472e79d0805060

in /etc/fonts/conf.avail/ and symlinking it to /etc/fonts/conf.d/
It seems to work well with chromium, somewhat less so with firefox.
