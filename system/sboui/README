sboui is an ncurses-based user interface for sbopkg, sbotools, and similar tools
to manage packages built from SlackBuilds.org scripts. Unlike other Slackware
system administration tools with dialog-based user interfaces, sboui is written
in C++ utilizing low-level ncurses library calls. It features a two-pane listing
of software groups and names, multiple filters, searching, forward and inverse
dependency resolution, tagging multiple packages to apply batch changes,
configurable colors, and more. In addition to supporting the well-known SBo

package managers, it is also easy to make it work with custom tools.

Note: the only required dependency is libconfig, but you also need to have an
SBo package manager installed for it to be useful.

package managers, it also includes a built-in package manager, and it is easy to

=======
sboui is a package management tool for SlackBuilds.org (SBo). It features an
ncurses user interface that combines the user-friendliness typically found in a
GUI with the efficiency, light weight, and portability of a text interface. It
can function as a stand-alone package manager or serve as a front-end to sbopkg,
sbotools, or custom package managers. Its main features include forward and
inverse dependency resolution, blacklisting, storing build options for scripts,
a menu bar, full mouse and keyboard support, and more.

Optional dependencies (see build options for more information):

python-requests (for system tray notifier)
psutil (for system tray notifier)
gksu, ktsuss (instead of kdesu to launch from the desktop)
ninja (to build with ninja instead of make)

Build options:

INSTALL_SYSTRAY_NOTIFIER=yes|no (default no): install a cronjob to sync the
  local repository hourly and display a system tray notification when SBo
  package updates are available. To use the system tray notifier, add
  sboui-update-notifier as a startup application for your desktop environment or
  window manager. If this is enabled, python-requests and psutil become
  dependencies.

GRAPHICAL_SU=kdesu|gksu|ktsuss (default kdesu): change the graphical su command
  for launching sboui from the .desktop file and system tray notifier. gksu or
  ktsuss becomes a dependency if selected here.

TERMINAL_EMULATOR=(user choice; default xterm) set the terminal emulator to run
  sboui via the .desktop file and system tray notifier.

USE_NINJA=yes|no (default no): use ninja instead of GNU Make for the build. If
  enabled, ninja becomes a dependency.
