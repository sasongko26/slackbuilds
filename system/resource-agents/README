resource-agents (cluster service executables)

Combined repository of OCF agents from the RHCS and Linux-HA projects

You might also want to install corosync, pacemaker, resource-agents, crmsh,
fence-agents and eventually cluster-glue.

Define OCF_ROOT and eventually OCF_RESKEY_<param> if you need to test the
resource executables manually.
