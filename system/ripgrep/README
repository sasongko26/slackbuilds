ripgrep - line oriented search tool

ripgrep is a line oriented search tool that combines the usability of
The Silver Searcher (similar to ack) with the raw speed of GNU grep.

By default, the slackbuild requires all crate dependencies to be downloaded
individually. Optionally, if you already have cargo-vendor installed, you can
create a "vendored" tarball which contains all the crate dependencies exploded
into a single directory and then compressed together as a tarball.

The script ripgrep-mkvendortarball.sh will generate this for you. The
slackbuild will automatically use this tarball if found in the current
directory.
