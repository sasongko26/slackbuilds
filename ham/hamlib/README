Hamlib (the ham radio control libraries)

Hamlib is a development effort to provide a consistent C language
interface for programmers wanting to incorporate radio controls
in their programs.  Network daemons for radio and rotator control,
along with language bindings for C++, Perl, Python, and TCL are
included.

Although this release of Hamlib includes an Lua language binding,
the lua package from slackbuilds.org is 5.1.5 but 5.2 or newer
is required.  Consequently, the Lua binding has not been included
in this Slackbuild script.
