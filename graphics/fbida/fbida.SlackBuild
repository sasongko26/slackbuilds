# Modified again on 20140915 by B. Watson <yalhcru@gmail.com>
# - Took over maintenance, minor script cleanup

# 20150508 bkw: update for v2.10

# 20161015 bkw:
# - update for v2.12
# - add optional motif support, since Slack 14.2 has real Motif. Also
#   add .desktop and icon, if motif was included.
# - actually apply SLKCFLAGS
# - 2.12 has a new fbpdf command, which I've renamed to
#   fbipdf to avoid conflicting with the fbpdf package
# - include French man pages, which aren't installed by default
