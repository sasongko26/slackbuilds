transmission (bittorrent client)

Transmission is a lightweight open source BitTorrent client, providing
useful functionality without feature bloat. It consists of a daemon, a
GTK+ client, and CLI client [*].

By default, all 3 components are built. Specific parts can be disabled
by setting one or more environment variables:

GTK=no
CLI=no
DAEMON=no

At least one component must be enabled (so all 3 set to "no" won't work).

[*] If you're wondering about the Qt client that was in the previous
    version of transmission: It's no longer possible to build on
    Slackware 14.2 as of transmission-3.0.0, due to outdated g++ and
    libstdc++. If you don't mind using an older version of transmission
    (2.94), you can install transmission-qt4 to get a Qt GUI.
