sshfs-fuse (ssh file system module for FUSE)

SSHFS (Secure SHell FileSystem) is a file system for Linux capable of 
operating on files on a remote computer using just a secure shell login 
on the remote computer. On the local computer where the SSHFS is mounted, 
the implementation makes use of the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) 
kernel module. 

The practical effect of this is that the end user can seamlessly interact 
with remote files being securely served over SSH just as if they were 
local files on his/her computer. On the remote computer the SFTP subsystem 
of SSH is used.
