The ownCloud Sync Client is a desktop program you install on your computer.
You specify one or more directories on the local machine to sync with your
ownCloud server, and always have your latest files wherever you are.  Make
a change to the files on one computer, it will flow across the others using
the desktop sync clients.

This package optionally requires the Sphinx package in order to create its
man pages.

Note:  You must build this package against the same version of Qt that
       qtkeychain was built against.  This package will automatically build
       against qt4.  If you wish to build this package against qt5 then you
       must set the flag BUILD_WITH_QT4 to 'No' when building this package.
       For example:

       # BUILD_WITH_QT4=No ./owncloud-client.SlackBuild
