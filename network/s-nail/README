S-nail (mail sending and receiving utility)

S-nail provides a simple and friendly environment for sending and
receiving mail. It is intended to provide the functionality of the
POSIX mailx command, but is MIME capable and optionally offers
extensions for line editing, S/MIME, SMTP and POP3, among others. It
divides incoming mail into its constituent messages and allows the
user to deal with them in any order. It offers many COMMANDS and
INTERNAL VARIABLES for manipulating messages and sending mail. It
offers simple editing capabilities, and increasingly powerful and
reliable non-interactive scripting capabilities.

NOTE

This package conflicts with Slackware's mailx package. You should
remove mailx before installing this package.
