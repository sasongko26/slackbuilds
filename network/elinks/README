elinks (ELinks - Full-Featured Text WWW Browser)

ELinks is an advanced and well-established feature-rich text mode web
(HTTP/FTP/..) browser. ELinks can render both frames and tables, is
highly customizable, and can be extended via Lua or Guile scripts. It
is very portable and runs on a variety of platforms. It also uses
SpiderMonkey javascript support.

There are a number of options that can be used to add support for
other protocols etc. To enable or disable an option use the following
method:

MOUSE=no ./elinks.SlackBuild

Several options can be combined together.
