Lightweight Tox client that uses Xlib.
Supports many features and is on-par with other Tox clients.

To build with GTK3 support instead of the default GTK2, execute:
    GTK3=yes ./uTox.Slackbuild

Since version 0.13.1, uTox REQUIRES libraries from the c-toxcore
package. Please note c-toxcore's README which recommends removal
the toxcore package prior to building.
