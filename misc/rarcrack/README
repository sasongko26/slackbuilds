rarcrack (password cracker for rar/7z/zip archives)

rarcrack uses a brute force algorithm to guess your encrypted
compressed file's password.

This program can crack zip, 7z and rar file passwords.

Optional (recommended) dependencies: At runtime, you'll need unrar to
crack rar files, and/or p7zip to crack 7z files.
