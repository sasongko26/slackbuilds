Image::Magick - objected-oriented Perl interface to ImageMagick. Use it
to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images from within a Perl script.

This Perl extension allows the reading, manipulation and writing of a
large number of image file formats using the ImageMagick library. It
was originally developed to be used by CGI scripts for Web pages.
