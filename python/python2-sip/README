SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for
C and C++ libraries.  It was originally developed to create PyQt,
the Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create
bindings for any C or C++ library.

This is an updated version of the stock slackware package. It should not
interfere with the stock version.

To build against this library in your python2 applications you will need to
tell your application the binary name and/or include path:

/usr/bin/python2-sip
/usr/include/python2.7/python2-sip/

To use the module in your python2 projects, it is named PyQt5.sip.
