Migen (Milkymist generator)

A Python toolbox for building complex digital hardware.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Migen FHDL library replaces the event-driven paradigm with the 
notions of combinatorial and synchronous statements, has arithmetic 
rules that make integers always behave like mathematical integers, and 
most importantly allows the design's logic to be constructed by a 
Python program. This last point enables hardware designers to take 
advantage of the richness of the Python language - object oriented 
programming, function parameters, generators, operator overloading, 
libraries, etc. - to build well organized, reusable and elegant
