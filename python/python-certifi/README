Certifi is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the
trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts.
It has been extracted from the Requests project.

The internet is an untrusted place. Every HTTP request you make should have
verification on by default. This happens every time you access a website with
your web browser, without any knowledge to the user — there’s no reason your code
should be any different.

Certifi is here to make this possible.
