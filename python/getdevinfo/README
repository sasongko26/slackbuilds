getdevinfo (A device information gatherer for Linux and macOS)

Working on both Linux and macOS, this script makes use of lshw,
lvdisplay, and blkid (Linux), as well as diskutil (macOS) to get
a comprehensive amount of disk information.

This information is available in a structured dictionary for ease
of use. On Linux it requires lshw, blkid, and lvdisplay to be
installed. On Linux, you need beautifulsoup4 (bs4), and lxml to
use this tool.
