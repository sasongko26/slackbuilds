Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework.  Qt's
primary feature is its rich set of widgets that provide
standard GUI functionality.

This is a legacy build of the old 5.9.x LTS version.

The following are optional dependencies that Qt will link
against if they are detected at build time:

libwebp opus pcre2 snappy libinput

============================================================

OPTIONS

To use Qt's built-in ccache option:

  CCACHE=yes ./qt5-legacy.SlackBuild

To build the documentation:

  DOCS=yes ./qt5-legacy.SlackBuild

To build the examples:

  EXAMPLES=yes ./qt5-legacy.SlackBuild

To build support for proprietary media codecs:

  PROPRIETARY_CODECS=yes ./qt5-legacy.SlackBuild

(this will produce a non-redistributable package in some
countries)

To disable support for pulseaudio:

  PULSEAUDIO=no ./qt5-legacy.SlackBuild

(Qt will automatically detect if pulseaudio is not installed
at build time and disable it if it is missing.)

To NOT build qtwebengine (EXPERIMENTAL):

  WEBENGINE=no ./qt5-legacy.SlackBuild


Combine any or all of the above.

============================================================

GENERAL NOTES

After upgrading qt5-legacy it is important to rebuild qt5ct
too, if it is installed, or some applications may not
display or function correctly.

Please report any problems about applications that don't
work correctly to the qt5-legacy maintainer or to the
mailing list.

============================================================

BUILDING WITHOUT WEBENGINE

YMMV whether it works with an application or not, but if you
have no intention of using the browser code, which includes
a chunk of 3rd party Google Chromium source, then it may
make sense to skip it and save yourself about 2/3 of the
build time.

The package version has _nowebengine appended to it for
clarity.
