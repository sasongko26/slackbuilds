# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

qca-qt5: qca-qt5 (Qt Cryptographic Architecture for Qt5)
qca-qt5:
qca-qt5: QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto API,
qca-qt5: using Qt datatypes and conventions. QCA separates the API from the
qca-qt5: implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage of
qca-qt5: this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly
qca-qt5: depending on any particular cryptographic library. This allows one
qca-qt5: to easily change or upgrade crypto implementations without needing
qca-qt5: to recompile the application.
