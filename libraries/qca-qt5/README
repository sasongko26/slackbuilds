Qt Cryptographic Architecture for Qt5

QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto API,
using Qt datatypes and conventions. QCA separates the API from the
implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage of
this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly
depending on any particular cryptographic library. This allows one
to easily change or upgrade crypto implementations without needing
to recompile the application.

QCA was written by Justin Karneges.
