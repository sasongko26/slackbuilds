AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) is an Open Source video codec designed for
video transmission over the Internet. AV1 is planned to surpass
VP9 and also to eventually be a competitor with HEVC/H.265.

This libaom SlackBuild builds two 'reference' applications:

  1. aomenc: an AV1 encoder
  2. aomdec: an AV1 decoder

Libraries are available for those who wish to build an AV1 encoder 
(libaom-av1) with a recent version of FFmpeg by specifying
'--enable-libaom' in the FFmpeg ./configure string.
