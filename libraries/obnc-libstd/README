obnc-libstd (Standard Library for OBNC)

This package complements the basic libraries bundled with OBNC (the Oberon
compiler obnc) with modules for accessing command line arguments and
evironment variables, printing to the standard error stream and converting
numbers to strings and viceversa.

Be sure to update the compiler package (obnc) before updating this library
package, as it usually needs the latest compiler features in order to
compile.
