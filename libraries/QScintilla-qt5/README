QScintilla includes features especially useful when editing and debugging
source code.  These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code
completion, and call tips. The selection margin can contain markers like those
used in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line.  Styling
choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional
fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and background colours, and
multiple fonts.

Building qscintilla-qt5 while an older verion is installed can cause run-time
errors. To avoid issues, unistall the current package before running this
script.
