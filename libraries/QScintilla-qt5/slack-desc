# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

QScintilla-qt5: QScintilla includes features especially useful when editing and
QScintilla-qt5: debugging source code.  These include support for syntax styling,
QScintilla-qt5: error indicators, code completion, and call tips.  The selection
QScintilla-qt5: margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to
QScintilla-qt5: indicate breakpoints and the current line.  Styling choices are
QScintilla-qt5: more open than with many editors, allowing the use of
QScintilla-qt5: proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and
QScintilla-qt5: background colours, and multiple fonts.
