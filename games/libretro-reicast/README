Reicast is an Sega Dreamcast and Sega Naomi video game system emulator
that can be used as a libretro core.

The Dreamcast BIOS files are required to run Reicast.

* dc/dc_boot.bin
* dc/dc_flash.bin

Due to a bug in Reicast, emulated memory cards will not save by default.
You can use the following workround:
  1. Start a game with libretro-reicast.
  2. Open the core options, they can be found in the RetroArch quick menu.
  3. Enable 'Boot to BIOS (restart)', then close and restart the emulator.
  4. In the Dreamcast bios menu, select 'File' and reformat the memory card.

To build Reicast OIT with the newer OpenGL 4.3 renderer use:
  OIT=1 ./libretro-reicast.SlackBuild

When building the OpgnGL 3 Reicast core it can be built with an older
and more compatbile OpenGL 2 code path instead by using:
  GL2=1 ./libretro-reicast.SlackBuild

Building Reicast with OpenGL 2 support should only be done if required
by your video card.

Reicast OIT will require an OpenGL compatibility profile to work
correctly.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./libretro-reicast.SlackBuild
