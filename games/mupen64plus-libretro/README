Mupen64Plus is a cross-platform plugin-based N64 emulator which is capable of
accurately playing many games.

Mupen64Plus optionally supports using OpenGL ES 2 instead of OpenGL which
will require support in the libretro frontend, video card and driver. This
can be done by building Mupen64Plus with:
  GLES=1 ./mupen64plus-libretro.SlackBuild

Vulkan can be used instead of OpenGL. This will require both a video card and
driver that supports it, but Slackware does not yet provide any Vulkan support,
so providing the correct system environment is up to you.
To build with Vulkan use:
  VULKAN=1 ./mupen64plus.SlackBuild

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./mupen64plus-libretro.SlackBuild
