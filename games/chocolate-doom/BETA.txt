It's now possible to build chocolate-doom-3.0.0-beta1 with this script,
though the default is still to build 2.3.0 (the latest stable release).

If there's ever a 3.0.0-beta2 or -beta3, you may be able to build those
too. I don't have a time machine, so I can't test them since they don't
exist yet :)

Manual build
------------

The beta has switched to using SDL2, so you will need SDL2, SDL2_mixer, and
SDL2_net installed.

To build the beta version, download the source from:

https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/archive/chocolate-doom-3.0.0-beta1.tar.gz

The md5sum is: da0439cb91db310c3342461ddd96ce16

Set VERSION to 3.0.0_beta1 in the environment. Example:

# VERSION=3.0.0_beta1 sh ./chocolate-doom.SlackBuild

Notice the _ in the version number! Do not use a hyphen (-), Slackware
can't handle version numbers with hyphen in them.


Tool-assisted build
-------------------

If you use sbopkg or sbotools, you can replace chocolate-doom.info with
chocolate-doom.info.beta, either by copy/pasting the contents or just
copying the file.


Config file
-----------

chocolate-doom's config file location has moved. In 2.3.0, user
config files were kept in "~/.chocolate-doom/". 3.0.0-beta1 uses
"~/.local/share/chocolate-doom/". You should be able to just copy your
*.cfg files from the old location to the new one.
