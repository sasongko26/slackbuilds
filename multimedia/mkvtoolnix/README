MKVToolnix is a set of tools to create, alter and inspect Matroska
(and WebM) files. With these tools one can:

  * Get information about Matroska files (mkvinfo)
  * Extract tracks/data from Matroska files (mkvextract)
  * Create Matroska files from other media files (mkvmerge)
  * Modify properties of existing Matroska files (mkvpropedit)

Note: This comes with internal versions of libembl and libmatroska.
Configure will use the internal versions if it fails to find them or
they are unusable.

Interested parties can build QT version of GUI by passing QTGUI=yes.
