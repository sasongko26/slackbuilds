opera-developer-ffmpeg-codecs (Extra ffmpeg codec for Opera browser)

Additional support for proprietary codecs for opera-developer.

This will add H.264 support to Opera Developer and not replacing the
default /usr/lib/opera-developer/libffmpeg.so.

NOTE: the recent versions of Opera Developer (> = 48.0.2636.0) require
the NSS library >= 3.26, this version is not available in the stable
release 14.2, so this script will not receive updates until the next
version of Slackware is available.
