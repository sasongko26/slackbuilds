vobsub2srt  (convert VOBSUB subtitles to SRT)

VobSub2SRT is a simple command line program to convert =.idx= / =.sub= subtitles
into =.srt= text subtitles by using OCR.  It is based on code from the
MPlayer project.  Some minor parts are copied from ffmpeg/avutil headers.
Tesseract is used as OCR software.

vobsub2srt is released under the GPL3+ license. The MPlayer code included is
GPL2+ licensed.

The quality of the OCR depends on the text in the subtitles. Currently the code
does not use any preprocessing.  But you can correct mistakes in the =.srt=
files with a text editor or a special subtitle editor.
