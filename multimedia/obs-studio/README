This project is a rewrite of what was formerly known as "Open Broadcaster
Software", software originally designed for recording and streaming live
video content, efficiently.

For full functionality, plug-ins using jack, luajit and vlc will be
constructed if those packages (all available at SBo) are detected at
build time.

Another optional build requirement is the mbedtls package which is used
to provide RTMPS support. However it will be disabled unless at least
version 2.7.0 of the mbedtls package is detected at build time.

Due to the cmake version in Slackware-14.2,
the latest buildable version of obs-studio is restricted to version 24.0.6.
