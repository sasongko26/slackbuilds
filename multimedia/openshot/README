OpenShot Video Editor is a free, open-source, non-linear video editor.
It can create and edit videos and movies using many popular video,
audio, and image formats.

Blender is an optional runtime dependency (for animated titles),
as is inkscape. To use them, set the full paths for the blender and
inkscape executables in the preferences menu.

* Note that httplib2 (openshot REQUIRES httplib2) must have been built
using the python3 option (by setting PYTHON3=yes in the build environment).
* Similarly, python-requests also needs python3 to be installed when
being built but no special setting is needed in this case.
