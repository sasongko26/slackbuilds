Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

This will build rust from source, which requires using the "official" stage0
compiler for the version being built from rust-lang.org, which is currently
the previous stable version.

If you already have rust and cargo installed, this slackbuild will use these to
bootstrap itself.

You can also force either behaviour through the LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP=yes|no
parameter.

  LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP=no ./rust.SlackBuild
