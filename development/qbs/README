QBS - The Qt Build Suite

Qt Build Suite (Qbs) is a tool that helps simplify the build process for
developing projects across multiple platforms. Qbs can be used for any
software project, whether it is written in Qt or not.

Qbs is an all-in-one tool that generates a build graph from a high-level
project description (like qmake or cmake) and additionally undertakes
the task of executing the commands in the low-level build graph (like make).


Notes:

1. Please remove any previous version of qbs before building.

2. Sometimes the old qbs profiles do not work when updating qbs.
   These files are located in the ~/.config/QtProject/qbs directory.
   Deleting this directory and recreating the profiles is a possible
   workround.
