# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mkchroot: mkchroot (create chroot-able directory tree)
mkchroot:
mkchroot: mkchroot creates a chroot-able directory tree using hard links where
mkchroot: possible. The mkchroot package consists of 3 utilities: mkchroot,
mkchroot: addchroot and findslack. mkchroot creates a minimal initial tree
mkchroot: and addchroot incorporates Slackware packages into that tree.
mkchroot: findslack is a utility used by the others to discover a Slackware
mkchroot: install directory. (The package is usable without an install directory
mkchroot: but has less functionality because it can't then run install scripts).
