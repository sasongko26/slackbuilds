mkchroot (create chroot-able directory tree)

mkchroot creates a chroot-able directory tree using hard links where
possible. The mkchroot package consists of 3 utilities: mkchroot,
addchroot and findslack. mkchroot creates a minimal initial tree
and addchroot incorporates Slackware packages into that tree.
findslack is a utility used by the others to discover a Slackware
install directory. (The package is usable without an install directory
but has less functionality because it can't then run install scripts).
(Before running the install script, addchroot uses the FILE LIST
portion of the package file in /var/log/packages to install a
package's directories and files).
