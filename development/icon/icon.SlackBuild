# Installation creates bin, lib, man, and doc dirs inside the "dest" dir.
# Edit the Install rule to avoid having to manually rearrange files.
# The bin and lib dirs need to share a parent directory, but we don't want
# to clutter /usr/lib with icon files, nor /usr/bin with demo programs and
# a shared lib.  Move both to /opt/icon, the suggested canonical location.
