OpenCPN is a free software (GPLv2) project to create a concise chart
plotter and navigation software, for use underway or as a planning
tool. OpenCPN is developed by a team of active sailors using real
world conditions for program testing and refinement.

If you are upgrading or installing new, OpenCPN 5.x now requires
that wxGTK3 be built with webkitgtk support.  So you will have to
install webkitgtk available here at SBo, then build and install
wxGTK3.

OpenCPN only looks for plugins in the "lib" directories. So on
x86_64 we have to pass an environment variable to use plugins.
The menu launcher will automatically set this for you, however
if you choose to launch OpenCPN from the command line you must
launch it with this command to get plugin support on x86_64.
