# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

apulse: apulse (PulseAudio emulation for ALSA)
apulse:
apulse: The program provides an alternative partial implementation of the
apulse: PulseAudio API. It consists of a loader script and a number of shared
apulse: libraries with the same names as from original PulseAudio, so
apulse: applications could dynamically load them and think they are talking
apulse: to PulseAudio. Internally, no separate sound mixing daemon is used.
