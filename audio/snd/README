Snd is a sound editor modelled loosely after Emacs.  It is highly
programmable, supports a variety of audio and sample file formats,
includes a complete implementation of Common Lisp Music (CLM), can be
run sans GUI as a scripting engine, and more.

This SlackBuild configures Snd to use Scheme (s7), ALSA, and Motif, as
these are currently the best supported (and tested) options.  As
Slackware 14.2 includes Motif and the GNU Scientific Library (gsl),
both dependencies can now be the preferred defaults.

If desired, enable support for OpenGL rendering of spectrograms:
  OPENGL=yes sh ./snd.SlackBuild
This is not appropriate for all configurations, so this option is
probably best left disabled (the default).
