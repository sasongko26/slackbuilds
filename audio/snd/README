Snd is a sound editor modelled loosely after Emacs.  It is highly
programmable, supports a variety of audio and sample file formats,
includes a complete implementation of Common Lisp Music (CLM), can be
run sans GUI as a scripting engine, and more.

This SlackBuild configures Snd to use Scheme (s7), ALSA, and Motif, as
these options are well-supported by Snd's author and extensively tested.
But if you prefer GTK3 to Motif, then enable it like so:
  GTK=yes sh ./snd.SlackBuild

Support for OpenGL spectrogram rendering can also be enabled:
  OPENGL=yes sh ./snd.SlackBuild
This option is not appropriate for all configurations, so it is disabled
by default.
