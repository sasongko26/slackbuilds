zathura is a highly customizable and functional PDF viewer based on the
poppler rendering library and the gtk+ toolkit. The idea behind zathura
is an application that provides a minimalistic and space saving interface
as well as an easy usage that mainly focuses on keyboard interaction.

This build includes the zathura core and the zathura-pdf-poppler plugin.

Other plugins exist to support other file types:

zathura-pdf-mupdf - Alternate PDF renderer (faster, maybe more accurate)
zathura-ps - PostScript
zathura-cb - Comic book archives (cbz/cbr/cb7/cbt)
zathura-djvu - DjVu

When upgrading zathura, you must rebuild all its plugins
against the new version of zathura, even if the version numbers
are the same.

texlive is an optional dependency, required for synctex support. If you
don't know what this is, you almost certainly don't need it.

zathura 0.3.8 is the last possible update for Slackware
14.2. Newer versions would require a newer gtk+3.

zathura 0.3.8 is the last possible update for Slackware
14.2. Newer versions would require a newer gtk+3.

Optional dependency: office/texlive. If zathura is built on a system
with texlive installed, synctex support will be included. Documentation
on zathura's synctex support is poor; for some hints on using synctex
with zathura, see:
