Apache FOP is a print formatter driven by XSL formatting objects. It
is a Java application that reads a formatting object tree conforming
to the XSL 1.1 Recommendation (05 December 2006) and then turns it
into a PDF document, certain other output formats or allows you to
preview it directly on screen. 

Note that not all parts of the XSL 1.1 specification have yet been 
implemented.

This is the old fop 2.0 for the incredibly ancient jdk 6 (including
openjdk6).  If you are running jdk 7 or newer, please use fop, also
available on SBo.

Also note that fop and fop2.0 cannot coexist on the same computer.

jai is an optional but recommended dependency.
