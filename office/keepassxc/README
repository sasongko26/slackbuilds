KeePassXC is a password and personal data management application that supports
the KeePass Password Safe file format.

KeePassXC is a fork of KeePassX that aims to incorporate stalled Pull Requests,
features, and bug fixes that are not being incorporated into the main KeePassX
baseline. KeePassXC may be installed alongside KeePassX (also available as a
SlackBuild).

KeePassXC can be built with YubiKey two-factor authentication support for
unlocking the database. This introduces a dependency on ykpers and can be
enabled by passing XC_YUBIKEY=ON to the script.

KeePassXC will be built with http support, meaning that it can retrieve favicons
from web sites and function as password storage for Mozilla Firefox and
Chromium/Chrome. This may be disabled by passing XC_HTTP=OFF to the script.

Autotype may be disabled by passing XC_AUTOTYPE=OFF.
