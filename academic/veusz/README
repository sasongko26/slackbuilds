Veusz - A Scientific Plotting Package

Veusz is a scientific plotting package.  It is designed to produce
publication-ready PDF or SVG output. Graphs are built-up by combining
plotting widgets. The user interface aims to be simple, consistent and
powerful.

Veusz provides GUI, Python module, command line, scripting, DBUS and
SAMP interfaces to its plotting facilities. It also allows for
manipulation and editing of datasets. Data can be captured from
external sources such as Internet sockets or other programs.

Sphinx is an optional dependency (used to rebuild the manual).
